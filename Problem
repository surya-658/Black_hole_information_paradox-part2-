we showed that information falling into a black-hole-like system is not destroyed, but instead becomes highly scrambled and delocalized. The key outcome was verifying the existence of information after scrambling. 

part 2 starts with the question:
Can we reconstruct the fallen information using only the qubits emitted as Hawking radiation?

The answer is we cannot directly measure or read out the original information so instead we work on : how much of that information can be recovered from correlations in the radiation?
