1. collect the radiated qubits and entangle them with a addiational output qubit .
2. impose a set of quantum gates on the output qubit 
3. Perform a SWAP test between the referance system(part 1) and the radiated-derived system that we just created .
The resulting overlap indiactes how much of the original quantum correlation can be operationally recovered which basically means up to what extent did we descramble the information .

The quantum gates used :
1. cx , cx (these gates allow information that is distributed across many qubits to be coherently concentrated into one system)
2. rx , ry , rz (these gates are used to align the recovered state into the correct basis)

Applying these gates to the radiation-derived system and optimizing the rotation angles via a grid search, the SWAP test yielded an overlap of ~75%, showing that a substantial fraction of the original quantum correlations can be recovered despite the information not being directly measurable.
